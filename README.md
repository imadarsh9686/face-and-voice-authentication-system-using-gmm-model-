# Speaker Recognition(GaussianMixture model) with 3d face Liveness Recognition system face_recognition library (Siamese architecture)

The project involves two important systems - a speaker recognition system and a 3D face liveness recognition system. The combination of these two systems creates a more secure and accurate authentication system.

The speaker recognition system is based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a statistical model used to represent the probability distribution of a set of observations. In this case, the observations are the voice characteristics of a speaker. The system identifies speakers based on their voice characteristics such as pitch, tone, and accent. The GMM model is trained on a dataset of voice samples from different speakers, which enables it to accurately recognize the voice of a specific speaker.

The 3D face liveness recognition system, on the other hand, determines if the face in an image is real or fake. This is important because face recognition systems can be easily fooled by presenting a photo or a video of the face to the system. The 3D face liveness recognition system overcomes this limitation by creating a 3D model of the face and using this to determine if the face is real or fake. The system uses the face_recognition library to create a 3D model of the face and then applies a set of algorithms to determine if the face is real or fake.

The Siamese architecture is used to compare two images and determine their similarity. In this case, it is used to compare the voice characteristics of a speaker and the 3D model of the face to authenticate the user. The Siamese architecture consists of two identical neural networks that are trained on the same dataset. The two networks are then used to compare two images and determine their similarity. In this case, the two networks are used to compare the voice characteristics of a speaker and the 3D model of the face to determine if the user is authentic.

The combination of these two systems creates a more secure and accurate authentication system. The speaker recognition system ensures that the user is who they claim to be based on their voice characteristics, while the 3D face liveness recognition system ensures that the user is physically present and not using a fake photo or video. The Siamese architecture is used to compare the two features and authenticate the user.
